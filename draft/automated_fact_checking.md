Is Automated Fact-checking the Answer?
=====

Fake news is rampant and to fix it, people have been thinking about automated fact-checking, including myself.

This is a summary of my research on what has been done and what could be done as of now.

Generally, an automated fact-checker includes these components:

1. A web crawler that either crawl the whole web (like Google) or just collect information from a list of sources (e.g. news media, social media);

2. A Parser that transforms human sentences into structures computers can compute on;

3. A Bayes network that computes the relations of the terms.

In one sentence: “[T]he complexities of human fact checking can be approximated quite well by finding the shortest path between concept nodes under properly defined semantic proximity metrics on knowledge graphs.”
