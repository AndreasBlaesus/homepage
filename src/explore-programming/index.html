<h1>What is Programming</h1>

<h2>I. Computers are special machines</h2>

<p>
Computer programming is about giving instructions to a computer to change its functions.
	
<p>
Pretty simple idea, right? Well, this is really like sorcery when you think about it: Most other machines perform only specific tasks. A car moves you around, a freezer cools your food, and a typewriter types letters.

Your car would never freeze anything, nor could your typewriter be used for transportation.

<p>
Yet, a modern computer possesses seemingly infinite capabilities: it can play music, show you Wikipedia, display an interactive calendar, etc. More interestingly, you can download a new application to expand its powers, i.e., you can easily modify the machine so that it does what it wasn't specifically designed to do.

<p>
Why?

<p>
<b>Because computers accept programs</b>.

<p>
You see, it has always been possible to give instructions to machines: you step on the brake and the car decelerates; you press "s" and the typewriter imprints an "s" on the paper.

<p>
What makes computers special is that you can change the way they handle <i>future instructions</i> (without physical alterations). The brake pedal on a car always brakes (thankfully), no matter how you use the car, the "s" key on a typewriter always means letter "s", but on a computer, they "s" key may mean letter "s" in MS Word, or "go back" in a shooter game, or "stop" in a music player, depending on which program is running.

<p>
If you want to pull a prank on a friend and make his typewriter type "m" when "s" is pressed, it'll probably take you hours if not days to rewire the mechanical parts, perhaps even having to redesign the whole thing to make it work. However, it only takes a few lines of code to achieve the same effect on a computer (depending on the operating system).

<p>
Computers are machines that can be modifed and repurposed by the user, without physical alternation. And you modify a computer by feeding it different programs. In this sense, <i>computer programs are just a special type of instructions, <b>meta-instructions</b></i>, i.e. instructions that tells the machine to change the way it interprets future instructions. 

<p>
Therefore, programming is really just "designing".

<h2>II. The machine has a face</h2>

<p>
Have you noticed that we only rarely use computers to, you known, compute? Of course, underneath all software you use, the computer is really just computing on 0s and 1s, but what computers actually do today are quite vivid, and that is because computer have interfaces.
